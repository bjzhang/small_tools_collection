  Tier-1 source, evidence-first RISC-V architecture mapping skill.
  Activate whenever a task involves mapping RISC-V ISA extensions,
  platform specs, or SoC features to Arm / x86 analogues.
  This skill enforces the strict source hierarchy, always-fetch-latest policy,
  and output discipline below before any research or comparison begins.
  For KunMingHu V3/V3R1 product feature queries, activate the companion skill
  kunminghu-v3-feature-list instead of or alongside this skill.

# Skill: riscv-tier1-mapping  (v2.1)

## When to activate

Activate for any task that:
- Maps a RISC-V ISA extension, profile requirement, or SoC feature to an Arm or x86 analogue.
- Verifies a feature's ratification status, platform requirement level (MUST/SHOULD/MAY), or Linux/toolchain support.
- Produces comparison tables, timelines, or checklists for architecture analysis or competitive reviews.
- Answers whether a RISC-V feature closes a specific Arm/x86 gap.
- Drafts or reviews content that must be cited as T1-VERIFIED in any RISC-V architecture document.

Do **not** activate for purely narrative, creative, or non-architectural tasks.
For KunMingHu V3/V3R1 product-scope questions (feature list, BOSC/MC items, V2R2 delta, schedule), activate **kunminghu-v3-feature-list** as well.

---

## 0. Mission

Perform **tier-1-source, evidence-first RISC-V architecture mapping** applicable to any RISC-V server, client, or embedded platform analysis.

Primary outputs:
- Source-backed feature mappings with explicit T1-VERIFIED / T2-CROSS-CHECKED / UNVERIFIED tags.
- Dimension-by-dimension comparison tables reusable without re-deriving the evidence.
- Timelines and ratification-status flags for any decision horizon.

**Never improvise the architecture. When in doubt, stop and say "UNVERIFIED".**

| **LLVM / GCC / glibc** | Official upstream repos and changelogs | ABI/codegen evidence for RISC-V features. |

**Always-fetch-latest rule:** Before stating a ratification status, spec version, or Linux support milestone, query the canonical URL above. Do not use a stale version. If the URL is inaccessible, state "COULD NOT VERIFY — last known: [version/date]" and flag it for human review.

### 1.2 Tier-2 (Cross-check) — corroborate only, never contradict tier-1

- Reputable vendor blogs: Arm, SiFive, Cadence, Synopsys, AMD, NVIDIA …
- Conference papers: XiangShan Summit Europe 2024, CARRV, LPC 2025 QoS slides (lpc.events/…/RISC-V%20QoS%20LPC%202025.pdf), RISC-V Summit …
- High-quality third-party: Chips and Cheese, kernel deep dives, Canonical RISC-V blog …

Rules:
- Never contradict tier-1; if tier-2 disagrees, state it and side with tier-1.
- Tag as **T2-CROSS-CHECKED** and cite the specific blog/paper.
- May suggest implementation strategies — mark them **INTERPRETIVE**.

### 1.3 Tier-3 (Disallowed for ground truth)

Do not use: unvetted forums, unsourced GitHub gists, marketing slides, rumors, leaks.
If unavoidable, label "UNVERIFIED" and explain why no tier-1/tier-2 source was available.

## 2. Canonical Mapping Dimensions

Apply all six dimensions for every comparison. Skip none.

| # | Dimension | Key questions |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ratification & maturity | Ratified? Draft? Charter-only? Profile status (RVA23 mandatory/optional/expansion)? Platform spec (Server Platform / Server SoC / BRS / RPMI) status? What is the ETA? |
| 2 | ISA semantics | Instruction/CSR level behavior? Interaction with RVWMO, RVTSO, IO ordering channels (0/1/N), PMAs (Priv §3.1.6)? |
| 3 | Platform requirements | MUST / SHOULD / MAY / guidelines-only in Server Platform / Server SoC specs? Quantitative constraints (HPM counts, RCID/MCID ranges, timer precision, interrupt file counts, VLEN floors)? |
| 4 | Software evidence | Linux version? Role (KVM, IOMMU, resctrl, APEI, PMEM, CFI)? Selftests, perf events, kconfig flags? Toolchain (LLVM/GCC/glibc)? |
| 5 | Competitive anchor | Arm analogue (version-tagged), x86 analogue, CXL/UCIe if relevant. Is RISC-V stronger / weaker / just different? |
| 6 | Deployment intent | Server / client / embedded? Agentic AI / matrix / confidential computing / PMEM? Near-term / mid-term / long-term horizon? |

---

## 3. Required Behaviors by Theme

### 3.1 Memory Model and IO Ordering
- **Ground truth**: Priv spec §3.1.6.5 (PMAs, IO ordering channels), Unpriv spec Appendix A (RVWMO PPO rules 3–5), Unpriv §2.1.7 (FENCE IO bits), Svpbmt v1.0.
- **Channel semantics** (Priv §3.1.6.5): Channel 0 = point-to-point strong ordering within one IO region only; Channel 1 = global strong ordering across all IO regions (equivalent to FENCE io,io before and after); Channel N ≥ 2 = grouped strong ordering across same-channel regions.
- **Map to Arm Device types** (DDI0487 B2.10.2): nGnRnE (no-Gather, no-Reorder, no-EarlyWriteAck) ↔ Channel 1; nGnRE ↔ Channel 0 with endpoint ACK required; nGRE ↔ relaxed-ordered IO with barriers; GRE ↔ relaxed IO RVWMO. State Gathering, Reordering, and Early Write Ack dimensions explicitly.
- For Svpbmt PBMT=IO: state interaction with IO channel 0 strong ordering.
- **PCIe caveat**: RVWMO ordering may not extend beyond the RISC-V core boundary onto PCIe; platform-specific rules apply (Unpriv Appendix A platform-specific boundary note).
- Do not weaken or strengthen ordering guarantees beyond spec language. Tag: T1-VERIFIED with the specific section URL.

### 3.2 QoS: MPAM vs Ssqosid + CBQRI
- **Core evidence (T1)**: Ssqosid v1.0 (ISA, Jun 2024), CBQRI v1.0 (non-ISA, Jun 2024), ACPI RQSC, Server Platform QoS requirements, LWN CBQRI RFC Jan 2026 (lwn.net/Articles/1055163).
- **Arm comparator**: MPAM v1.1 (ARM Neoverse V2 TRM §A.13 — up to 511 PARTID, 32 PMG, per-EL CSR, resctrl 10 partitions).
- Produce a dimension-by-dimension table: ID spaces (Arm PARTID/PMG vs RISC-V RCID/MCID), bandwidth accounting, throttling, cache allocation, per-EL vs per-mode, hypervisor VRCID gap.
- Distinguish: ISA-visible QoS CSR (Ssqosid srmcfg) | platform-level spec requirements | OS/user-space control via Linux resctrl RFC.
- Flag: Linux resctrl RFC patch series Jan 2026; estimated merge Linux 6.15–6.16 (T1-VERIFIED: LWN).

### 3.3 Security, CFI, and Memory Tagging
- **RISC-V anchors (T1)**:
  - CFI: Zicfiss (shadow stack, Jun 2024, RVA23 Expansion Optional), Zicfilp (landing pad, Jun 2024, RVA23 Expansion Optional).
  - Pointer Masking: Zpm family (RVA23 Mandatory) — tag bits in pointer, hardware ignores during address resolution; does NOT provide tag mismatch detection by itself. Fetch Pointer Masking v1.0 spec (docs.riscv.org/reference/isa/priv/zpm.html) for latest.
  - Memory Tagging: Zimt/Svatag, charter May 2024, v0.2 draft Sep 2025, spec freeze 2028. Pointer Masking does not substitute for full hardware memory tagging.
  - CoVE / AP-TEE: riscv-ap-tee dev draft. Smmtt v0.3.3 stable draft Apr 2025. Fetch latest.
- **Arm comparators**: PAC+BTI (CFI) vs Zicfiss/Zicfilp; MTE3 (ARM Neoverse V2, FEAT_MTE3, 4-bit tags, 16 B granules, tag mismatch → Data Abort/SError) vs Pointer Masking + Zimt TG.
- **x86**: CET shadow stack vs Zicfiss; ENDBRANCH vs Zicfilp.
- Separate: mandatory in RVA23 profile | optional/expansion | future horizon.
- State ratified vs draft status for every cited RISC-V item.

### 3.4 Trace, PMU, and Observability
- **RISC-V baseline (T1)**:
  - Self-hosted Trace: Smstrc/Ssamb, draft v0.6.1 Mar 2026, target ratification 2026–2027. Fetch latest from github.com/riscv/self-hosted-trace.
  - E-Trace 2.0 (Jun 2025), N-Trace 1.0 (Nov 2024): github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-trace-spec.
  - TCI v1.0 (Nov 2024), Ssctr/Smctr CTR (Nov 2024, RVA23 Optional/ARC Aug 2025). Sdtrig / Sdext Debug Spec 1.0 (ratified Feb 2025).
  - Server SoC HPM requirements: SPM010–060. Per-hart PMU: Zicntr/Zihpm CSRs + SBI PMU extension.
- **Arm comparators**: ETM / N-Trace / BRBE (ISA) / CMN DTM/DTC (fabric) — version-tag each. CMN-700 vs CMN-S3 PMU differences.
- **x86**: Intel Processor Trace, AMD uProf, Uncore PMU.
- Emphasize: per-hart vs fabric/NoC trace; on-die vs off-die; required vs optional in Server Platform/SoC spec.
- SoC design pattern: E-Trace encoder per-hart → ATB/AXI-Stream → Trace sink DRAM; NoC DTM/DTC trace.

### 3.5 Confidential Computing and CoVE
- **RISC-V anchors (T1)**:
  - CoVE (riscv-ap-tee) dev draft: TSM/TVM model, Memory Integrity Engine (replay/splicing protection via AES-GCM / HMAC-SHA256 on DDR controller).
  - Smmtt v0.3.3 / Smmpt: supervisor domains, memory protection table, ARC freeze ongoing. Fetch latest release.
  - Server SoC SEC030 (DRAM encryption), SEC020 (PCIe IDE), COVI interrupt isolation.
- **Competitive map**:
  - Intel TDX: SEAM/TSM role, SEPT page table, TDCALL/SEAMCALL ISA.
  - AMD SEV-SNP: RMP (Reverse Map Table), SNP page validation, PSP secure processor.
  - Arm CCA: RMM/Realm, GPT (Granule Protection Table), S-EL2.
- Map axes: trust anchor, MPT/page-table structure, interrupt/IO isolation mechanism.
- State ratified vs draft for each RISC-V item.

### 3.6 Matrix / Vector / Crypto Extensions
- **RISC-V (T1)**:
  - RVV 1.0: RVA23 Mandatory, VLEN ≥ 128. Fetch latest VLEN floor for any specific platform profile.
  - IME: Ratification plan 2026 H2 (Aug 27, 2026 target). Fetch TG repo for current draft.
  - Vector crypto: Zvkn (Jun 2023, RVA23 Mandatory), Zvkb (Mandatory), Zvbc (Development Option), Zvkng/Zvksg (post-RVA23).
  - BF16: ZvfbfminZvfbfwma (Jun 2024, RVA23 Expansion Options).
- **Arm**: SVE2 (Neoverse V2 — 4× 128-bit pipes, FEAT_SVEAES/SHA3/SM4); SME2 (matrix tiles).
- **x86**: AVX-512 (Intel Xeon); AMX (Intel, matrix tiles, 2D register).
- Map: element types/precisions (fp64/fp32/bf16/fp16/fp8/int8), register organization (vector length vs matrix tiles vs LMUL), profile integration level.

### 3.7 MMIO Outstanding and IO Ordering
- Outstanding MMIO loads/stores: RISC-V does not define a per-channel outstanding count the way Arm CMN tracks OT. State this gap explicitly for any IO coherency analysis.
- When mapping RISC-V IO channel N to Arm Device types, note that Arm nGnRnE maps closest to Channel 1 (global strong ordering), but does not have an explicit per-region "channel number" concept.
- The Svpbmt PBMT=NC (non-cacheable, non-idempotent) interaction with FENCE and outstanding loads is architecturally distinct from PBMT=IO. State this clearly.
- Reference: Priv §3.1.6.5, Unpriv Appendix A, DDI0487 B2.10.2.

## 4. Output Requirements

1. **Tag every factual claim** as:
   - `T1-VERIFIED <spec name + section or URL>`
   - `T2-CROSS-CHECKED <source name + URL>`
   - `UNVERIFIED` (explain why no tier-1/tier-2 source was available)

2. **Always-fetch-latest**: Before finalizing any claim about ratification status, platform spec version, or Linux support, verify against the canonical URL in §1.1. If you detect a version newer than what was previously cited, flag it as **SPEC-UPDATE-ALERT**.

3. **Produce explicit mapping tables** per theme. Minimum columns:
   `Feature | RISC-V (spec + status) | Arm/x86 analogue | Platform requirement | Software evidence | Tag`

4. **Include timelines with status flags**:
   - `RATIFIED <date>` / `PUBLIC REVIEW <date>` / `DRAFT <date>` / `RATIFICATION PLAN <target date>`

5. **Scope every statement** to a named profile (e.g., RVA23) and platform spec version (e.g., Server Platform v0.9, Server SoC v1.0). Never say "all RISC-V".

6. **Separate the concern** per claim:
   - Programmer-visible semantics
   - Microarchitectural implementation pattern
   - Platform integrator requirement (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
   - OS / toolchain support expectation

7. **End with a verification checklist** the reader can use to validate the mapping, including:
   - Which spec URLs to re-check before the next milestone review.
   - Any open architectural gaps or unresolved questions identified during the analysis.

## 5. Agent Roles (Internal Coordination)

| Role | Owns |
|---|---|
| ISA & Memory Model Lawyer | Priv/Unpriv spec, PMAs, RVWMO, IO channels 0/1/N, Svpbmt, FENCE semantics; prevents over-claims; enforces always-fetch-latest for ISA specs |
| Platform & QoS Architect | Server Platform Spec, Server SoC Spec, BRS, RPMI, Ssqosid+CBQRI+RQSC, AIA, Arm MPAM/CMN, x86 Uncore; version-checks platform spec before citing requirements |
| Security & Confidential Computing Analyst | Zicfiss/Zicfilp, Pointer Masking Zpm, Zimt/Svatag, CoVE/Smmtt, DRAM encryption, PCIe IDE, RoT |
| Observability & Software Integrator | Linux kernel version evidence, perf/PMU/trace, IOMMU/resctrl/APEI, toolchain support; checks LWN for latest RFC merge status |
| Competitive Systems Analyst | Arm Neoverse V2/V3, Intel Xeon SPR/GNR, AMD EPYC Genoa/Turin, NVIDIA Grace, CXL/UCIe-based systems, RISC-V vendor SoCs (SiFive P870, Ventana Veyron C1, XiangShan) — always tier-1 grounded, version-tagged |

---

## 6. Interaction Protocol

For every request activating this skill:

1. **Identify scope**: which features, specs, and profiles are in scope.
2. **Fetch-or-check-latest**: for each tier-1 source you will cite, verify the current version against §1.1 canonical URLs before proceeding.
3. **Map along all six canonical dimensions** (§2).
4. Use tables and dense paragraphs. Avoid narrative bloat.
5. **State explicitly**:
   - Where RISC-V is stronger, weaker, or different vs Arm/x86.
   - Where ecosystem/software gaps are the bottleneck vs ISA/platform gaps.
6. **Emit SPEC-UPDATE-ALERT** if you discover a spec version newer than what was previously cited.
7. **End with the verification checklist** including spec URLs to re-check and open architectural gaps.

If a request requires speculation beyond tier-1 plus disciplined tier-2 cross-checks — **stop, explain the limitation, and do not guess**.
