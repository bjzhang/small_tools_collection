  End-to-end RISC-V CPU requirement skill covering three complementary modes:
  (1) Requirement analysis workflow — ingest external specs (RVA23, SP3, RAS,
  IOMMU, CXL, etc.), produce feature-mapping CSVs with source tags and mapping
  types, surface red-line conflicts, split deliverables into consultant-visible
  and internal versions, and package a versioned release zip.
  (2) Feature list reference — 20 SoC feature items, 66 Server Platform / SoC
  requirements, 28 Arch Freeze items, work-item tracking, V2R2→V3R3 delta, and
  the V3R1/V3R2/V3R3 feature horizon.
  (3) Requirement query — intelligent lookup over requirement document sets with
  structured answers, member-need cross-referencing, and spec-priority mapping.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks you to:

**Requirement Analysis Workflow (Part 1)**
- Build or refresh a CPU requirement matrix (mapping external specs → internal feature list).
- Run a gap analysis for a release (V2, V3, V4, …).
- Freeze a release gate's feature list (e.g., Rx Arch Freeze, Rx Full Feature, Rx Tape-out Ready).
- Surface red-line conflicts between consultant input and internal decisions.
- Package a consultant-visible release zip while keeping internal-only material intact.
- Update an existing mapping CSV without losing the frozen baseline naming.

**Feature List Query (Part 2)**
- Look up whether a specific feature is On-SoC / Hybrid / Not Now / V3R1 / V3R2 / V3R3.
- Verify the V2R2 → V3R3 delta (what is new, what carries over, what is deferred).
- Answer which work item maps to which SoC feature.
- Check MUST / SHOULD / MAY / P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 priority for any V3R3 item.
- Produce a structured view of the 20 SoC features, 66 platform requirements, or 28 Arch Freeze items.
- Answer competitor positioning against V3R3 (SiFive P870-D, NVLink Fusion, Arm Neoverse V2/V3, Intel Xeon, AMD EPYC).
- Schedule and horizon questions (V3R1 Arch Freeze, V3R2 full feature, V3R3 code freeze).

**Requirement Document Query (Part 3)**
- Query requirement documents by ID (e.g., "04-02-01"), by topic ("performance requirements"), or by member need.
- Compare requirement deltas (V2 → V3 increments).
- Compare spec differences (RVA23 mandatory vs Server Platform 1.0).
- Cross-reference member needs across multiple members.

**Trigger phrases**: "Vx requirement", "RVA23 mapping", "SP3 mapping", "Arch Freeze", "consultant release", "_internal_", "requirement query", "feature list", "member needs".

## Part 1: Requirement Analysis Workflow

### Project Conventions (HARD RULES)

These rules come from prior sessions. Follow them unless the user explicitly overrides.

1. **Project codename uses the version only**: `MEMBER-00-GP V3` (not `V3R1`, not `V3R3`). Spell the codename as configured in your project settings.
2. **Release gates** use the `Rx` suffix:
   - `Rx Arch Freeze` — locks features with deep micro-arch impact.
   - `Rx Full Feature` — implementation complete for all in-scope features.
   - `Rx Tape-out Ready` — verification + DV sign-off.
3. **CSV file names keep the gate suffix that froze them.** Example: a mapping frozen at R1 stays `MEMBER-00-GP-V3R1-requirement-with-mapping.csv` even after R2/R3 narratives are added.
4. **Internal-only files MUST be prefixed `_internal_`.** Consultant-visible files have no prefix.
5. **Never delete content** when splitting into consultant + internal versions. Crop the consultant copy from the internal master via line-range extraction; keep the full internal master intact.
6. **Preserve red-line conflicts** in the consultant Master Report (typically §1.1).
7. **Do not translate** Chinese sections unless the user explicitly asks. English-only deliverables (README, frontmatter) are the exception.
8. **Source tags** are required on every claim:
   - `[T1-VERIFIED]` — primary spec or internal authoritative source.
   - `[T2-CROSS-CHECKED]` — confirmed by >=2 secondary sources.
   - `[UNVERIFIED]` — single source or inference.
9. **Mapping types** are required on every row of the mapping CSV:
   - `[exact]` — 1:1 spec-to-feature mapping.
   - `[approximate]` — semantic match, naming differs.
   - `[composite]` — feature combines multiple spec items.
   - `[N/A]` — internal feature with no external spec counterpart.
10. **Top-level analysis** is delivered as `L1-investment-and-competition-analysis.md` and `L2-SoC-system-level-analysis.md`. Specialty research (e.g., dynamic-TSO, AME comparison) lives in `04_专题/` and is **excluded from the consultant zip** unless the user asks otherwise.

### Workflow Overview

```
Input baselines (CSVs + specs)
  |
  |-- Phase 1: Ingest & normalize    -> references/01-mapping.md
  |-- Phase 2: Build mapping CSV     -> references/01-mapping.md + scripts/build_mapping.py
  |-- Phase 3: Red-line review        -> references/02-red-lines.md
  |-- Phase 4: Master Report split   -> references/03-delivery-packaging.md
  |-- Phase 5: CSV cleanup            -> scripts/clean_csv.py
  `-- Phase 6: Consultant zip         -> references/03-delivery-packaging.md
```

Read each `references/*.md` file when you reach that phase — they hold the detailed instructions and decision rules.

### Phase 1 — Ingest & Normalize Inputs

Inputs the user typically provides for a new Vx round:

- Top-level requirement CSV (internal): `_internal_MEMBER-00-GP-Vx-top-level-requirement.csv`
- ISA / non-ISA spec extract: `_internal_MEMBER-00-GP-Vx-ISA-non-ISA-spec-requirement.csv`
- External spec references: RVA23 profile, RVB23, SP3 server platform, RAS APEI, IOMMU, CXL 3.0/3.1, MPAM/CBQRI.
- Prior version baseline (V2 checklists, V2R2 SP2 feature list).

Steps:

1. Confirm the version label (V3, V4, …) and the active gate (R1/R2/R3).
2. Place all internal inputs under `01_输入基线/` with `_internal_` prefix.
3. Identify the consultant-visible competition table (e.g., `MEMBER-00-GP-Vx-requirement-competition-table-vN.csv`) — this is shipped without the prefix.

Output of this phase: a clean `01_输入基线/` directory and a documented input list in the Master Report §0.

### Phase 2 — Build the Mapping CSV

Read `references/01-mapping.md` for the full column spec and tag rules.

The mapping CSV must have these 12 columns (header carries a UTF-8 BOM so Excel renders Chinese correctly):

```
Feature ID, Feature Name, Category, Spec Source, Spec Section,
Mapping Type, Source Tag, Internal Owner, Status (R1/R2/R3), Priority, Notes, Red-Line Flag
```

Each row gets a `[mapping type]` and `[source tag]` from the conventions above. Rows with red-line conflicts get `Red-Line Flag = Y`.

### Phase 3 — Red-Line Review

Read `references/02-red-lines.md` for examples and resolution patterns.

A red-line conflict is any case where:

- Consultant input contradicts an internal decision (frozen at a prior gate).
- Two external specs give incompatible requirements (e.g., RVA23 vs SP3 vs CXL).
- A feature's gate assignment (R1 vs R2 vs R3) is disputed.

For every red-line:

1. Record both positions verbatim.
2. Mark the conflict in Master Report §1.1.
3. Do not auto-resolve — surface for the user's decision.
4. If the user defers, mark the row `[讨论中]` (under discussion) in the gate column.

### Phase 4 — Master Report Split

Read `references/03-delivery-packaging.md` for the full file layout and line-range extraction approach.

Two outputs:

- `_internal_Vx_Master_Report.md` — full internal master (kept intact).
- `Vx_Master_Report.md` — consultant version, cropped via line-range extraction. Always keeps §0 (overview + milestone table + Rx micro-arch list) and §1.1 (red-lines).

Build via `scripts/build_consultant_report.py`. Specify keep-ranges as `(start, end)` line tuples. Never edit the consultant report by hand-typing — always re-run the script so changes are reproducible.

The §0 milestone table for any Vx looks like:

| Milestone | Date | Scope | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| VxR1 — Arch Freeze | YYYY-MM | Lock features with deep micro-arch impact | e.g., SPECINT2006 >= N/GHz |
| VxR2 — Full Feature | YYYY-MM | All N features implemented | Functionally complete |
| VxR3 — Tape-out Ready | YYYY-MM | Verification + DV sign-off | Tape-out gate |

R1 micro-arch list (typical, mark each `[讨论中]` until user signs off): V/RVV, Zvfhmin/Zvbb/Zvkt/Zfa/Zfh, Zacas/Zabha/Zawrs, Dynamic TSO, Svadu/Sv57/PA52/Svvptc/Svnapot/Svinval, Sstc/Sscofpmf/AIA/Sha, Zicfilp/Zicfiss/Zimop/Zcmop, Zicbom/Zicboz/Zicbop/Zic64b, B umbrella/Zicond/Zihintntl/Zihintpause/Zkt.

R2 list (typical): Zvkn/Zvks/Zvfh/Zvfbf*, IOMMU, RAS APEI, CXL 3.0/3.1, NUMA, MPAM/CBQRI, trace.

### Phase 5 — CSV Cleanup

Run `scripts/clean_csv.py` on every consultant-visible CSV before packaging. It:

- Removes fully empty rows.
- Removes fully empty columns.
- Preserves the UTF-8 BOM on the header line.
- Leaves cell content untouched.

### Phase 6 — Consultant Release Zip

Read `references/03-delivery-packaging.md` for the canonical layout. Summary:

```
MEMBER-00-GP-V{N}-Consultant-Release-{YYYYMMDD}/
|-- README_Consultant_EN.md
|-- 00_Overview/
|   `-- V{N}_Master_Report.md
|-- 01_Requirement/
|   |-- MEMBER-00-GP-V{N}R{gate}-requirement-with-mapping.csv
|   |-- RVA23-ServerPlatform-ISA-NonISA-Mapping.csv
|   `-- MEMBER-00-GP-V{N}-requirement-competition-table-v{ver}.csv
`-- 02_Top-level-analysis/
    |-- L1-investment-and-competition-analysis.md
    `-- L2-SoC-system-level-analysis.md
```

Exclude from consultant zip:

- All `_internal_*` files.
- `04_专题/dynamic-TSO-research.md`, `04_专题/AME-comparison-research.md` (and any other specialty research not explicitly approved).

After packaging, share via the asset name `MEMBER-00-GP_V{N}_Consultant_Release` so version history accumulates on the same asset.

### Quick-Start: New Vx Round

1. Confirm version + active gate with the user.
2. Drop input CSVs into `01_输入基线/` with `_internal_` prefix where applicable.
3. Run `scripts/build_mapping.py` -> consultant mapping CSV.
4. Identify red-lines -> update Master Report §1.1.
5. Run `scripts/build_consultant_report.py` -> consultant Master Report.
6. Run `scripts/clean_csv.py` on every consultant-visible CSV.
7. Assemble zip per the Phase 6 layout.
8. Share with name `MEMBER-00-GP_V{N}_Consultant_Release`.

### Anti-Patterns (Do Not Do)

- Translating Chinese content without explicit instruction.
- Renaming a frozen mapping CSV (keep the gate suffix forever).
- Deleting `_internal_*` files when splitting deliverables.
- Including dynamic-TSO or AME research in a consultant zip.
- Auto-resolving red-line conflicts.
- Hand-editing the consultant Master Report instead of re-running the build script.
- Using `V3R1` or `V3R3` as a project codename — it's `MEMBER-00-GP V3`.
- Using the words "scrape" or "crawl" in any user-facing text.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Requirement Document Query
- **By requirement ID**: "query 04-02-01" or "member need analysis for 04-02-01"
- **By topic**: "performance requirements", "RAS requirements", "security requirements"
- **By member need**: "MEMBER-02-ZTE requirements", "MEMBER-00-ESWIN requirements", "which members need Zvkng?"

#### 2. Structured Answer
For each query, extract:
- Requirement source (member name, competitive analysis, foundation spec)
- Associated RVA23 Server Platform 1.0 spec entry
- Precise document reference (filename, section number, work item ID)
- Member requirement status (priority A/B/C or 1/2/3, not mentioned)

#### 3. Delta Comparison
- **V2 -> V3 increment comparison**: list added/modified requirement entries
- **RVA23 mandatory vs Server Platform 1.0**: compare spec differences, mark choices
- **Multi-member cross-reference**: e.g., "which members need Zvkng?"

#### 4. Spec Priority Mapping
Return references in this priority order:
1. UDB (user database record, if exists)
2. Nomination rules
3. RISC-V Foundation spec (RVA23.1 Server Platform 1.0)

```

#### Compact Answer Mode (for simple queries)
```markdown
04-02-02 requires single-core SPEC06 >= 65 points.
Reference: `your-project/RISC-V_CPU_requirement/04-02-02-Single-core-SPEC06-65point.md`
```

### Constraints (MUST NOT)

1. **Do not modify requirements**
   - Do not create, edit, or delete requirement documents
   - Do not suggest requirement changes (handled by requirement change process)

2. **Do not make technical decisions**
   - Do not evaluate implementation feasibility
   - Do not provide architecture design suggestions
   - Do not recommend technical solutions

3. **Do not execute database operations**
   - Do not execute SQL queries (avoid SQL execution errors)
   - Do not modify database records
   - All queries based on filesystem reads

4. **Do not override spec authority**
   - Do not modify RISC-V Foundation spec text
   - Do not re-interpret spec semantics (avoid ambiguity)
   - When spec conflicts exist, mark "needs manual confirmation"

### Typical Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: RVA23 Server Platform Requirement Query
**User question**: "What are the RVA23 server platform requirements for Q4?"
**Expected output**:
- List all RVA23 compliance entries in 04-02-01
- Classify by priority (A/B/C/under discussion/not needed)
- Mark implementation status

#### Scenario 2: V2 -> V3 Increment Query
**User question**: "What new requirements does V3 add compared to V2?"
**Expected output**:
- List added entries by requirement ID
- Associate member sources
- Mark implementation priority

#### Scenario 3: Requirement vs Spec Difference Query
**User question**: "RVA23 mandatory vs Server Platform 1.0, which does V3 choose?"
**Expected output**:
- Compare RVA23 Profile and Server Platform 1.0 differences
- Mark V3's choice (e.g., "force-merge RVA23.1 key features")
- Reference 04-02-01 relevant sections

#### Scenario 4: Multi-Member Cross-Reference Query
**User question**: "Which members need vector crypto instruction sets?"
**Expected output**:
- List all members needing vector crypto (MEMBER-02-ZTE, MEMBER-00-ESWIN)
- Specific entries (Zvkng, Zvksg, Zvbc)
- V2R2 not implemented, V3 mandatory

#### Scenario 5: Requirement Document Precise Location
**User question**: "Where are the RAS requirements in 04-02-00?"
**Expected output**:
- Filename and section number (`04-02-00.md §RAS·QoS·BMC`)
- Cross-reference 04-02-01 ISA-native detailed analysis
- Related member requirement links

### Member Priority System

- **MEMBER-02-ZTE**: Uses A/B/C priority (A=confirmed requirement, B=needed, C=optional)
- **MEMBER-00-ESWIN**: Uses 1/2/3 priority (1=mandatory, 2=needed, 3=optional)
- Other members (MEMBER-03-JD, MEMBER-01-SN, MEMBER-04-LX): Not mentioned = no declared requirement
- Member need analysis is located in the `## Member Need Analysis` section of each document

> **Template note:** Replace MEMBER-XX-XXX placeholders with your actual stakeholder identifiers and priority systems before use.

### Supported Query Modes

1. **Direct Q&A**: "What are the performance requirements for V3?"
2. **Document reference**: "What is the single-core SPEC06 target in 04-02-02?"
3. **Comparison query**: "What are the RAS differences between V2 and V3?"
4. **Spec mapping**: "What is the status of RVA23 mandatory Zvksg in V3?"

## Interaction Protocol

For every request activating this skill:

1. **Identify the specific feature or requirement** by its ID: SoC-N, IO-N, PM-N, Sec-N, DT-N, MM-N, Arch Freeze item 20-29, or Server Platform req #1-66, or work item ID.
2. **State V3R3 scope** (On-SoC / Hybrid / Not Now) and priority (P0/P1/P2/P3).
3. **State V2R2 heritage** (new in V3, carry, or enhanced).
4. **Map to spec requirement** (MUST/SHOULD/MAY/RECOMMENDS) and cite the Server Platform, Server SoC, or BRS requirement ID.
5. **Cross-reference open items**: if the feature has an open work item, state the current risk level and open action.
6. **Cross-reference the V3R1/V3R2/V3R3/V4 horizon** if the feature is partially in scope.
7. **Invoke riscv-tier1-mapping** for any deep architectural mapping question (e.g., "how does Ssqosid compare to MPAM?" -> hand off to riscv-tier1-mapping).
8. **Evidence-tag all factual claims**: T1-VERIFIED / T2-CROSS-CHECKED / UNVERIFIED per the source hierarchy.

If asked about a feature not in this list, say so explicitly and suggest whether it belongs to V3R2 / V3R3 / V4 or is out of scope.
